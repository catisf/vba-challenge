UoB Bootcamp - VBA challenge

This repository has the results of Challenge #2 of the UoB Data Analytics bootcamp. 

It contains:
- screenshots of the results for each year in the spreadsheet given
- vba script used to obtain those results

Source code:
- the for loop looping through each row of stocks was adapted from here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59441711/how-to-find-the-first-and-last-values-in-a-conditional-loop-in-vba
- the code to loop through worksheets and to apply conditional formatting to highlight cells in a given colour is based on what we learned in class
